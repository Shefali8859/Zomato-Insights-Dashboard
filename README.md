🍽️ Zomato Insights: Restaurant Analytics Dashboard
An interactive and visually engaging Power BI dashboard designed to analyze restaurant data from Zomato—focusing on ratings, pricing, locations, and cuisine types to reveal key business insights for the food service industry.

The Zomato Insights Dashboard provides an intuitive overview of restaurant performance across various cities. It helps users identify top-rated restaurants, understand cost patterns, explore popular cuisines, and benchmark city-wise food trends. This tool supports data-driven decision-making for restaurateurs, marketers, and analysts.

The dashboard was built using the following technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for data visualization and dashboard creation.
• 🔄 Power Query Editor – Used for transforming, filtering, and preparing Zomato data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For dynamic measures, KPIs, and custom logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships were established among multiple tables (e.g., Restaurants, Cuisines, Locations) to support cross-filtering and aggregated analysis.
• 📁 File Format – .pbit (Power BI Template) for sharing and reuse.

Source: Zomato Restaurant Dataset (publicly available datasets).
Structure:
Restaurant name, rating, votes

The dataset allows in-depth analysis of restaurant trends by geography, popularity, and price points.
